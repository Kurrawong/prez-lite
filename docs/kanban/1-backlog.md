### ✅ Integrate SHACL validation into data processing and browser
Generic SHACL validation using any validator files in `data/validators/`. Already implemented: `--validators` CLI flag, `rdf-validate-shacl`, validation badges on vocabs list and scheme pages, expandable error details, `--strict` mode.

### Fix sign-in redirect to return to current page
Clicking sign in on a vocab/concept page redirects to home instead of returning to the same page after OAuth flow completes.

### ✅ Evaluate concept ordering in vocabularies
Research whether ordering of concepts within a vocabulary is important, possible, or necessary — and if so, what mechanism to use (e.g. `skos:notation`, `sh:order`, custom predicate). Analysis complete: alphabetical sufficient for most cases; notation-based sorting recommended as opt-in feature for classifications.

### Enable editing of concept label and IRI
Users can't update the label or IRI when editing a concept. Add editable support for these core fields in the edit form, with appropriate validation.

### Add concept move/reparent capability
Provide an intuitive way to move a concept from one parent node to another in the hierarchy — e.g. a move button or drag-and-drop, updating `skos:broader`/`skos:narrower` relationships.

### Redesign edit mode chrome (toolbar, save, panels)
Replace the bottom save banner with a more intuitive UX: top ribbon when logged in, edit mode toggle, save button on changes, toggle panels for change summary, TTL diffs, and history. The history icon is too easy to miss.

### Add simplified/expert view toggle for properties
Hide RDF-specific properties (like `hasTopConcept`, `inScheme`) behind an "expert" toggle, showing a friendlier default view for non-RDF users. Derived properties should not be editable in simple mode.

### Adopt test-driven development workflow
Update the sprint skill to incorporate TDD practices; audit existing features for test coverage; review and update existing tests so regressions are caught early when code changes.

### ✅ Implement incremental data deployments
Detect which vocabs have changed and only rebuild those exports, plus dependent assets (vocab list, search index, labels) — avoid full rebuild on every push while keeping everything consistent.

**Future optimizations (when vocab count exceeds ~50):**
- Skip `build:labels` in CI when `data/background/` hasn't changed (~1-2s saving)
- Orphan cleanup: remove `web/public/export/vocabs/{name}/` when source `.ttl` is deleted
- Add `data/background/**` and `data/config/**` to workflow trigger paths (changes there require full rebuild)
- Local `pnpm build:data:incremental` command using git status to detect changed vocabs

### 👀 Export constraints.jsonld from SHACL validator
Export full SHACL shapes as JSON-LD for frontend validation consumption. Includes `sh:or` flattening, cardinality, datatypes, classes, severity, messages. Also documented shacl-ui library evaluation.

### ✅ Enforce SHACL cardinality constraints in edit mode
Extract `sh:minCount`/`sh:maxCount` from `data/validators/vocabs.ttl` at build time, merge into `profile.json`, and use in the edit UI to control add/remove button visibility.

### Design collaborative editing presence (who's online)
Assess real-time presence system (avatars, editing indicators) similar to Google Docs; evaluate Cloudflare Durable Objects, Supabase Realtime, or similar for broadcasting edit state across clients of the same GitHub repo.

### ✅ Add build status polling after save
Poll GitHub Actions API after saving edits to show rebuild progress; auto-dismiss on completion and clear caches.

### ✅ Add vocab edit history with version browsing
History popover showing commit list (author, date, message); diff view between versions; browse any historical version read-only via URL param.

### Design edit-to-publish data lifecycle
Define the branching and staging strategy for data changes vs UI changes across both the base prez-lite project and child gh-template projects — covering dev/staging/production environments, when data rebuilds trigger, and how the two project types differ in their edit-to-publish flow.
