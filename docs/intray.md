when editing something like lang the feedback on the difference does not clearly show the lang has changed, just shows the text has changed.

when mousing over a history edit drop down the height changes due to showign undo icon, make it so the height does not change.

there is no title on the popup diff box or on save changes box, the title area is blank.

both boxes should be draggable.

when you switch from inline/full with a concept in context, it looses context when switch

make the concept panel take up 20% more width, and make the panel resizable so you can make the concept panel wider or narrower, this should be retained.

when i pick a random item as narrower, sometimes no change happens. is this because it's invalid, if so there should be some kind of error message.

when we pick a related, broader or narrower concept, we should be able to pick using a selector tree with search, like our current concept tree with search. is this reusable for this purpose? can we design it to be common enough. i know the web component has this design support.
