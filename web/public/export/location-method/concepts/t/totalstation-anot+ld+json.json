These can be either features directly observed in the field (e.g. site/outcrop descriptions, structural readings, etc.) or obtained from legacy and current documents/datasets (e.g. airphotos, maps, previously published reports, exploration reports, etc.). Each location method has a spatial accuracy that indicates an estimate of the approximate error in the location.
