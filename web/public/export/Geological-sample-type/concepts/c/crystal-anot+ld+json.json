Artefacts are also included, but in this vocabulary they specifically refer to man-made objects of cultural or historical interest such as a tool or decoration (i.e. items such as thin sections, mounts, etc. are not regarded as artefacts in this context). Descriptions were compiled trying to avoid reference to the material that comprises the specimen (e.g. rock, fossil) or the sampling method (e.g. drilling), although in practice it is not always possible to completely separate these concepts from the sample type (e.g. rotary sidewall core); in fact many of the concepts for sample type and sample materials are (incorrectly) used interchangeably.

Floaters can form when crystals grow within a matrix that is either soft or subsequently removed (such as from a clay); or it may be a crystal that formed attached to matrix but was subsequently detached during tectonic activity, with the broken attachment point later re-healed or extended by a secondary mineralization event. The term is generally not used for crystals that have been freed from hard matrix, such as garnets removed from schist, whether such removal was natural or artificial.

Geodes differ from vugs in that geodes can be separated free from any matrix, because their walls commonly weather out of rock exposures. Unlike a druse, a geode is separable (by weathering) as a discrete concretion from the rock in which it occurs, and its inner crystals are not of the same minerals as those of the enclosing rock. The crystals lining a geode are formed by the filling of vesicles in volcanic and subvolcanic rocks by minerals deposited from hydrothermal fluids; or by the dissolution of syngenetic concretions and partial filling by the same or other minerals precipitated from water, groundwater, or hydrothermal fluids in sedimentary rocks.",
