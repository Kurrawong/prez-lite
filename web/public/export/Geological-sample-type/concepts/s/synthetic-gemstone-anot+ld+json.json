The listing includes both primary samples and derived specimens, that is primary sources (e.g. drillcore, hand specimen) and items resulting from preparation of those source materials for the purpose of research/analytical work (e.g. thin section, fine powder). Artefacts are also included, but in this vocabulary they specifically refer to man-made objects of cultural or historical interest such as a tool or decoration (i.e. items such as thin sections, mounts, etc. are not regarded as artefacts in this context). Descriptions were compiled trying to avoid reference to the material that comprises the specimen (e.g. rock, fossil) or the sampling method (e.g. drilling), although in practice it is not always possible to completely separate these concepts from the sample type (e.g. rotary sidewall core); in fact many of the concepts for sample type and sample materials are (incorrectly) used interchangeably.
