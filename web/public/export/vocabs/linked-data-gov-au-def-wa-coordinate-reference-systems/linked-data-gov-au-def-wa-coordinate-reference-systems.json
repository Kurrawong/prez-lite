It was developed by the US Department of Defense and is maintained by the US National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA). WGS84 defines an Earth-centred, Earth-fixed coordinate reference system with an origin that coincides with a determination of the centre of mass of the earth, and a geodetic datum. The datum defines meridian 0 as the International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service (IERS) Reference Meridian and the datum surface is an oblate spheroid. Officially adopted as the world geodetic datum in 1984, WGS84 is a dynamic reference frame. WGS84 has been revised several times since its conception and is at present aligned at the centimetre level to the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), which generally ensures scientific integrity and compatibility with international standards and conventions. At the beginning of each year, the NGA updates station coordinates to account for plate tectonic motion. This means that WGS84 coordinates derived by users from GPS measurements will appear to move over time. In January 1994, GDA94 and ITRF were coincident, but since Australia is moving up to 7cm per year in a northeasterly direction, there was a 1.8 m difference between the two systems in 2020 — for applications that require uncertainty better than 5 m, GDA94 and WGS84/ITRF cannot be considered equivalent.

These longitudinal zones are numbered 1 to 60 – east from longitude 180°; the polar regions south of 80°S and north of 84°N are excluded. Each zone is characterized by a central meridian; as a result, within a zone nothing is more than 3° from the central meridian and therefore locations, shapes and sizes and directions between all features are very accurate. The UTM sometimes also uses 20 latitude bands, each 8° high, numbered A to Z (with O and I not being used) – north from Antarctica. The UTM was developed in 1947 by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).",
