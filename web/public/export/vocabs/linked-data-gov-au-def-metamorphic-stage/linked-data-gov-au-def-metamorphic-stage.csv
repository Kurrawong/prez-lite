This ambiguity arises, for example, when sluggish reaction kinetics in porphyroblastic minerals at low to moderate pressure/temperature metamorphic conditions lead to metastability.",,,,,https://linked.data.gov.au/def/metamorphic-stage

This term is used when metamorphic information is cryptically preserved, e.g. within inclusions in porphyroblastic minerals, or there is ambiguity about polymetamorphism.",,,,,https://linked.data.gov.au/def/metamorphic-stage

Typically used when the possibility of polymetamorphism is high and/or unclear, i.e. when it cannot be ascertained whether lower temperature metamorphic minerals overprinting a higher grade assemblage formed during the same, single metamorphic cycle, or whether a later, lower temperature event (i.e. retrogressive) overprinted the higher grade assemblage.",?retrogressive,,,,https://linked.data.gov.au/def/metamorphic-stage
