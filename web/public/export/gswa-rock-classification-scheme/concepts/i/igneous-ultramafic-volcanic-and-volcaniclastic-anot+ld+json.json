        "@value": "Listing of rock types and lithological nomenclature (and related codes) used by the Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) for the dual purpose of recording lithologies during mapping / core logging, and for representing mappable lithostratigraphic/lithotectonic units in the State. Rather than attempting to cover for all existing rock types and lithologies, the GSWA’s scheme and terms in this vocabulary are specifically informed by Western Australian geology; a companion vocabulary covers lithological equivalents for regolith materials. \n\nApart from the approach to classification of some volcanic (pyroclastic) rocks, GSWA's lithological nomenclature largely conforms to internationally recognized classifications such as Le Maitre et al. (2005) for plutonic/intrusive rocks and Fettes and Desmons (2007) for metamorphic rocks. Note that: a) GSWA prefers the term intrusive to plutonic, as it carries no inference on depth of emplacement; b) GSWA's rock classification scheme prefers the use of volcanic terminology for any igneous rock formed on or near the Earth's surface, i.e. for those hypabyssal or sub-volcanic rocks such as dykes, sills, and cryptodomes that are demonstrably both spatially and temporally associated with extrusive volcanic rocks; c) some intrusive mafic/ultramafic terminology is allowed for cumulate rocks originating from thick volcanic successions. In the absence of a single unified scheme for sedimentary rocks, multiple sources were considered, and definitions rely heavily on the Glossary of geology (5th edition, revised; Neuendorf et al., 2011). Full references listed under History Note.\n\nGSWA’s rock classification scheme is designed to provide consistent terminology within the organization, and primarily relies on features observable in all rocks at outcrop scale, in hand specimen, and in thin section. Additional terms cover for broader combinations of multiple lithologies encountered during mapping (especially for sedimentary rocks, e.g. ‘siliciclastic + lesser carbonate’), and to ensure a coherent approach across different rock types (e.g. use of ‘mylonitized’ for all metamorphic rock groups, even if some would be rare occurrences or difficult to identify in the field). Definitions in this vocabulary are largely compiled or derived from the quoted references and the Glossary of Geology (5th edition, revised, Neuendorf et al., 2011), with adaptions based on recommended GSWA usage; metamorphic lithologies are often derived from definitions of non-metamorphosed equivalents. Some mineralogical/petrological knowledge is expected of the reader.\n Each concept is characterized by a notation consisting of one to four lower-case letters. This notation represents the lithological code used for mapping lithologies and labelling lithostratigraphic units on maps. Note that in the GSWA's scheme, some lithological codes are reserved for use in the Field Observation database (WAROX) or the Explanatory Notes System (ENS) only; the latter are highlighted in the concept definitions and should not be used for field observations. Also note that in ENS codes are supplemented by primary and secondary qualifiers (not covered in this vocabulary); a concerted effort has been made to match WAROX-only codes with those generated via qualifiers in ENS, but in a few instances alphabetical limitations have prevented this (i.e. the code used in WAROX has a slightly different meaning from the same string of letters generated in ENS).\n\nThe approach behind GSWA’s rock classification scheme is documented in Tyler at al. (2004; https://dmpbookshop.eruditetechnologies.com.au/product/the-revised-gswa-rock-classification-scheme.do). Details of GSWA’s code construction for ENS can be found in Riganti et al. (2013; https://dmpbookshop.eruditetechnologies.com.au/product/gswa-code-builder-constructing-and-unravelling-gswa-geological-codes.do) and in a companion application, the GSWA Code Builder (ENS codes only), available from the Department’s Data and Software Centre (https://dasc.demirs.wa.gov.au/).",
