Ooliths are small round or ovate accretionary bodies resembling the roe of fish, with a diameter of 0.25 to 2 mm (commonly 0.5 to 1 mm), and usually formed of calcium carbonate (but also dolomite, silica, or other minerals) in successive concentric layers, commonly around a nucleus such as a shell fragment, an algal pellet, or a quartz-sand grain, in shallow, wave-agitated water; ooliths commonly show an internal radiating fibrous structure indicating outward growth or enlargement at the site of deposition, and are frequently formed by inorganic precipitation. Peloids are allochems composed of micrite, irrespective of size or origin, for which an exact origin is unknown (e.g. completely micritized fossils or ooids); other types of peloid include pseudo-ooids and aggregates produced by gas bubbling, by microbial precipitation, or by other intraformational reworking of lithified or semilithified carbonate mud.
