Geodes differ from vugs in that geodes can be separated free from any matrix, because their walls commonly weather out of rock exposures. Unlike a druse, a geode is separable (by weathering) as a discrete concretion from the rock in which it occurs, and its inner crystals are not of the same minerals as those of the enclosing rock. The crystals lining a geode are formed by the filling of vesicles in volcanic and subvolcanic rocks by minerals deposited from hydrothermal fluids; or by the dissolution of syngenetic concretions and partial filling by the same or other minerals precipitated from water, groundwater, or hydrothermal fluids in sedimentary rocks.","scheme":"https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geological-sample-type","schemeLabel":"Geological sample type","publisher":["https://linked.data.gov.au/org/gswa"]},{"iri":"https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geological-sample-type/grain","prefLabel":"grain","altLabels":[],"notation":"GRAN","definition":"An individual particle, either a mineral or fossil, sampled directly from an outcrop, drillcore or environment, or obtained from a concentrate, and stored in an unmounted state.","scheme":"https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geological-sample-type","schemeLabel":"Geological sample type","publisher":["https://linked.data.gov.au/org/gswa"]},{"iri":"https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geological-sample-type/grain-mount","prefLabel":"grain mount","altLabels":["dump mount"],"notation":"GRMT","definition":"A mount created from loose mineral grains that have been hand picked for the purpose of imaging or analysis.","scheme":"https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geological-sample-type","schemeLabel":"Geological sample type","publisher":["https://linked.data.gov.au/org/gswa"]},{"iri":"https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geological-sample-type/hand-sample","prefLabel":"hand sample","altLabels":["hand specimen"],"notation":"HAND","definition":"Portable, self-contained rock, fossil, regolith or mineral specimen collected for analysis and/or conservation.

The hammer can be either down the hole (DHH) at the bottom of the drillstring or at the top of the drillstring (top-hole hammer). Rotary hammer drilling is commonly referred to in industry as percussion drilling and is an ‘open hole’ method, meaning that the drill cuttings are blown up on the outside of the drill rods. Note that percussion is also applied in other methods. For example, reverse circulation (RC) drilling uses this cutting method, but the drill cuttings return to the surface within the drill rods. A rotary hammer is also a common component in rotary air blast (RAB) drilling. Usage of ‘rotary hammer’ is recommended for instances where the ’open hole’ sampling method is used but where details of the sample return method are unknown. It should be avoided if a more specific term is known (e.g. RAB or RC drilling), as well as where it represents only a minor component of the borehole drilling (e.g. bottom of hole for aircore drilling).","scheme":"https://linked.data.gov.au/def/borehole-drilling-method-western-australia","schemeLabel":"Borehole drilling method","publisher":["https://linked.data.gov.au/org/gswa"]},{"iri":"http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/boreholedrillingmethod/sonic","prefLabel":"sonic","altLabels":["SON","sonic drilling","vibratory"],"notation":"SON","definition":"A sonic or vibratory drillhead works by sending high-frequency resonant vibrations down the drillstring to the drillbit, while the operator controls these frequencies to suit the specific conditions of the soil/rock geology.

Any remaining fine material is removed by a secondary filter before the air passes through the vacuum pump and vented to the atmosphere.

The core sample is carried by an inner tube (core barrel) locked in place in contact with the drilling head. To recover the core, the drive system is disconnected, opening the top of the drillstring.

The nature of tectonic processes that modify cratons, including rifting, accretion and removal of the lithospheric root, result in boundaries between cratons, orogens and basins that can be either sharp or gradational, such that the spatial limit of cratons both at surface and at depth may not always be precisely defined.

WGS84 defines an Earth-centred, Earth-fixed coordinate reference system with an origin that coincides with a determination of the centre of mass of the earth, and a geodetic datum. The datum defines meridian 0 as the International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service (IERS) Reference Meridian and the datum surface is an oblate spheroid. Officially adopted as the world geodetic datum in 1984, WGS84 is a dynamic reference frame. WGS84 has been revised several times since its conception and is at present aligned at the centimetre level to the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), which generally ensures scientific integrity and compatibility with international standards and conventions. At the beginning of each year, the NGA updates station coordinates to account for plate tectonic motion. This means that WGS84 coordinates derived by users from GPS measurements will appear to move over time. In January 1994, GDA94 and ITRF were coincident, but since Australia is moving up to 7cm per year in a northeasterly direction, there was a 1.8 m difference between the two systems in 2020 — for applications that require uncertainty better than 5 m, GDA94 and WGS84/ITRF cannot be considered equivalent.
