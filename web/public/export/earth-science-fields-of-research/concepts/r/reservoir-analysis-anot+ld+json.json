Reservoir characterization models are used to simulate the behaviour of the fluids within the reservoir under different sets of circumstances and to find the optimal production techniques that will maximize the production. Typically, a reservoir analysis incorporates interpretation of depositional facies and diagenesis, mineralogical and textural maturity parameters obtained from macro/meso (e.g. cores, sidewall cores, cuttings) and micro (e.g. thin sections, scanning electron microscope work) samples, as well as direct and indirect measurements of porosity, permeability and grain density from well log analysis and core and mechanical sidewall cores.
