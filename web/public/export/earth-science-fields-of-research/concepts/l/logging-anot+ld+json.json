The log may be based either on visual inspection of samples brought to the surface (geological logs) or on physical measurements made on these samples or by instruments lowered into the hole (geophysical logs). Some types of geophysical well logs can be done during any phase of a well's history: drilling, completing, producing, or abandoning. Logging is performed in boreholes drilled for the oil and gas, groundwater, mineral and geothermal exploration, as well as part of environmental, geotechnical or geological studies.",

Although a large proportion of drilling is carried out in the pursuit of mineral and energy resources, core logging is also a critical component of other investigations (e.g. stratigraphic, geotechnical, etc.).",
