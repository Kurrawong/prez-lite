Traditionally, urban planning followed a top-down approach in master planning the physical layout of human settlements, with a primary focus on public welfare (i.e. considerations of efficiency, sanitation, protection and use of the environment) as well as effects of the master plans on the social and economic activities. Over time, urban planning's focus has shifted to social and environmental factors to be a tool to improve the health and well-being of people while maintaining sustainability standards.",
