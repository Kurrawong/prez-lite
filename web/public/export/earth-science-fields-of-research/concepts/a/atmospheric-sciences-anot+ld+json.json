In a broader sense, climate change science also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. These statistical properties include averages, variability and extremes. Climate change may be due to natural processes, such as changes in the Sun’s radiation, volcanoes activity or internal variability in the climate system, or due to human influences such as changes in the composition of the atmosphere or land use caused by human activity (e.g. burning of fossil fuels, deforestation). In common usage, climate change is often used interchangeably to describe global warming — the ongoing increase in global average temperature — and its effects on Earth's climate system.",
