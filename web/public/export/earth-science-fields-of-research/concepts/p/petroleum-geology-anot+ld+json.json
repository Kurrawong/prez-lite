Studies of conventional reservoir include assessment of rock properties, particularly porosity, permeability and compressibility, and of the timing and mechanism of trap formation, as petroleum source rocks, reservoir rocks, impermeable caprocks/seals must form in a favourable sequence to allow accumulation in reservoir rocks (following petroleum generation in source rocks and its ensuing migration therefrom).",
