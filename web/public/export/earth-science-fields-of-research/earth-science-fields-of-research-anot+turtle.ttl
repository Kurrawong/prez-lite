    skos:definition "A categorization of disciplines or topics that the broad field of Earth science can be subdivided into, i.e. a listing of the Fields of Research, or subjects, to which a geoscience dataset, publication, observation/activity, or entity pertains. The vocabulary also contains relevant disciplines that intersect with the various Earth science fields, such as biological sciences and built environment and design, as well as entries related to collection and heritage management. Notations included are those from the 2020 ANZSRC listing (see History Note) or in common use in the geoscience community. "@en;
    skos:historyNote "The listing combines Earth Science-related entries in the Fields of Research vocabulary from the 2020 Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification (ANZSRC, https://vocabs.ardc.edu.au/viewById/316 and https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/classifications/australian-and-new-zealand-standard-research-classification-anzsrc/latest-release), selected additions from the Geological Survey of Queensland (GSQ)'s Earth Science Data Category vocabulary (http://linked.data.gov.au/def/earth-science-data-category), and supplementary concepts of relevance to the work of the Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) and partner industry and research institutions. Definitions used are largely derived from: (a) the Glossary of Geology (Neuendorf, KKE, Mehl Jr, JP and Jackson, JA (editors) 2011, Glossary of geology (5th edition, revised): American Geosciences Institute, Alexandria, Virginia, USA, 800p.), (b) Wikipedia (https://www.wikipedia.org/), (c) the GSQ's earth Science Data Category vocabulary (http://linked.data.gov.au/def/earth-science-data-category), and many other online resources."@en;
