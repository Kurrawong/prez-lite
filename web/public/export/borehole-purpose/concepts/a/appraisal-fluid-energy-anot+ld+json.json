The vocabulary focuses on drilling purposes within the resources industry, with a focus on terminology as applied in the Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) databases. Some terms covered by jurisdictional legislation are highlighted in the provenance field. Variations in terminology within definitions (i.e. usage of borehole, well and wellbore) stem from usage in different sectors of the resources industry, but for the purpose of this vocabulary are considered to be equivalent. In the context of this vocabulary, the term fluid energy refers to sources such as gas, petroleum and geothermal, as covered by the Petroleum Legislation Amendment Act 2024, and is exclusive of mineral sources of energy (e.g. coal, uranium).
