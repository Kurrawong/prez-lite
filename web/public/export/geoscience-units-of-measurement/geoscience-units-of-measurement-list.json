Power is the rate at which work is done, or (equivalently) the rate at which energy is expended. One watt (W) is equal to a power rate of 1 J of work per second of time. This unit is used both in mechanics and in electricity, so it links the mechanical and electrical units to one another. In mechanical terms, one watt equals about 0.001 341 02 horsepower (hp) or 0.737 562 foot-pound per second. In electrical terms, 1 W is the power produced by a current of 1 A flowing through an electric potential of 1 V. The name of the unit honours James Watt (1736–1819), the British engineer whose improvements to the steam engine are often credited with igniting the Industrial Revolution.","notation":"W","scheme":"https://linked.data.gov.au/def/uom-geoscience","schemeLabel":"Geoscience units of measurement"},{"iri":"http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/WK","prefLabel":"week","definition":"Mean solar week.
