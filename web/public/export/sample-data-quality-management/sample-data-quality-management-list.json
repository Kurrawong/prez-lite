Elements and isotope ratios that have been characterised in this process are attributed with a certified value and uncertainty, specific to a certain analytical technique. CRMs are used to monitor accuracy and bias at the project laboratory relative to the certified values. They are also used to monitor drift over time within an individual laboratory and to identify significant failures in QC at the analytical batch level caused by abrupt changes in concentration related to re-calibration of instruments or procedural changes at the laboratory. CRMs can also be used to verify new or improved analytical techniques.","broader":"https://linked.data.gov.au/def/sample-data-quality-management/reference-material","scheme":"https://linked.data.gov.au/def/sample-data-quality-management","schemeLabel":"Sample data quality management"},{"iri":"https://linked.data.gov.au/def/sample-data-quality-management/check-assay-sample","prefLabel":"check assay sample","definition":"A sample that is analysed at a secondary laboratory as a check on the accuracy and precision of the analytical results of the primary laboratory. The methods used in the primary and check laboratories must be known to properly compare the results from the check samples.
