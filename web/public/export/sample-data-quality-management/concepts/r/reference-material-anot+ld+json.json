CRMs are used to monitor accuracy and bias at the project laboratory relative to the certified values. They are also used to monitor drift over time within an individual laboratory and to identify significant failures in QC at the analytical batch level caused by abrupt changes in concentration related to re-calibration of instruments or procedural changes at the laboratory. CRMs can also be used to verify new or improved analytical techniques.",
