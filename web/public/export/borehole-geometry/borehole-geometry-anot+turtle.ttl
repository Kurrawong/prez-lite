The list focuses on the primary and some derived/calculated parameters that are part of reporting for drilling activities, and does include specific processes/procedures related to the acquisition of some of these parameters (e.g. downhole directional survey). The vocabulary does not include colloquial terms used by industry or the various ways of projecting a borehole trace onto different planes (e.g. plan view, longitudinal projection, cross-section). The coordinate and vertical reference systems used to report borehole parameters are described in separate vocabularies (Western Australian coordinate reference systems and Vertical/depth reference systems, respectively). A companion vocabulary (Borehole configuration) covers the qualitative terms used to describe the intended configuration and trajectory of a borehole."@en;
