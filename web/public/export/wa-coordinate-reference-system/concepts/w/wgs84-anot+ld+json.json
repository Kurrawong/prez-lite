WGS84 defines an Earth-centred, Earth-fixed coordinate reference system with an origin that coincides with a determination of the centre of mass of the earth, and a geodetic datum.

Officially adopted as the world geodetic datum in 1984, WGS84 is a dynamic reference frame. WGS84 has been revised several times since its conception and is at present aligned at the centimetre level to the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), which generally ensures scientific integrity and compatibility with international standards and conventions. At the beginning of each year, the NGA updates station coordinates to account for plate tectonic motion. This means that WGS84 coordinates derived by users from GPS measurements will appear to move over time.
