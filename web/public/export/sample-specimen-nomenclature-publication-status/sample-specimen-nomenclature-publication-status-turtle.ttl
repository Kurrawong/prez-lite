    skos:definition "Listing of standard nomenclature types (typus) and publication statuses that may characterize fossil, mineral or meteorite samples/specimens held in the Geological Survey of Western Australia's collections. These terms should only be applied to physical items, and are not applicable to derived results or data. This vocabulary includes terms for type specimens as recognized under several international nomenclature codes (see History Note for details). Taxonomic schemes applied to different classes of objects each have their own set of accepted types, and can define the same term differently, so care should be taken to use the correct nomenclature when referring to type specimens; to minimize confusion, individual terms have been labelled with a suffix indicating the relevant code. Note that multiple statuses can apply to a single specimen (e.g. by definition a type specimen will always be described-and-published)."@en;
    skos:historyNote "The following have been used for the compilation of this vocabulary:\n1) International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN; 1999, with 2012 amendments) - www.iczn.org/the-code/the-code-online\n2) International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants (ICN; Shenzen Code, 2018) - www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/pages/main/glossary.html\n3) Guidelines for Meteorite Nomenclature (version dated July 2015) - www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/docs/nc-guidelines.htm\n4) International Mineralogical Association's mineral nomenclature scheme (IMA; published 1987) - www.minsocam.org/msa/ima/ima98(05).pdf\n5) Although not yet official, the Proposed International Code of Microbialite Nomenclature (PICMN, Grey and Awramik, 2020) specifies that 'Provisions in the Shenzhen Code Articles 9 and 10 should be followed in designating and naming microbialite types, and for reference to terminology relating to different types (e.g. lectotype, paratype, etc.) and the rules governing their use' (point 11, p. 196), and that advice is followed herein. Reference: Grey, K and Awramik, SM 2020, Handbook for the study and description of microbialites: Geological Survey of Western Australia, Bulletin 147, 278p.\nNote that a number of international codes of nomenclature are not included in this vocabulary due to their inapplicability to geological materials (i.e. International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes, International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants, International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature, International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature).\nGSWA distinguishes samples from specimens on the basis of the latter including both primary and derived materials and having been accessioned into a suitable management system."@en;
