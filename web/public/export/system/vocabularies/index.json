      "definition": "Compilation of terms that described geometry (i.e. the shape, distribution and configuration) of alteration in rocks and minerals as observed at the macro-, meso- and microscopic scale, and applying to the specific area of observation. Alteration in this context is defined as a modification of the original lithology caused by meteoric, connate, metamorphic, or magmatic-derived fluids, excluding the weathering environment, mineralization and direct magmatic or metamorphic processes. Definitions are largely taken from Pirajno (2009) and the Glossary of geology (Neuendorf et al., 2011).",

It provides a standard framework under which business units carrying out similar production activities can be grouped together, with each resultant group referred to as an industry.\r\n    An individual business entity is assigned to an industry based on its predominant economic activity. The term business entity is used in its widest sense to include any organisation undertaking productive activities, including companies, non-profit organisations, government departments and enterprises. ANZSIC has four hierarchic levels: Divisions (the broadest level), Subdivisions, Groups and Classes (the finest level).\r\n    At the Divisional level, the main purpose is to provide a limited number of categories which provide a broad overall picture of the economy and are suitable for the publication of summary tables in official statistics. The Subdivision, Group and Class levels provide increasingly detailed dissections of these categories for the compilation of more specific and detailed statistics.",
