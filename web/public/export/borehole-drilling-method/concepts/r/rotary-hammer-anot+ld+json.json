        "@value": "A list of drilling methods routinely used by the mineral and energy resource industries. The drilling methods are grouped into three main categories based on the dominant motion of the drillstem (i.e. the string of pipe that transmits power from the surface down to the drillbit) and drillbit (the part of the bottom-hole assembly that cuts, grinds or breaks the bottom-hole formation to make the hole). Specifically, the presence/absence of rotation in either or both is used as the main distinguishing factor, hence the main grouping into rotary, non-rotary and hybrid. Most drilling used by the mineral and energy resource industries falls into the rotary drilling category. Note that alternative classification schemes can use parameters such as the hole-making method in combination with the hole-clearing and stabilizing method and/or the type of sample produced (e.g. core versus chips). These methods can cross over between the main categories used here; for example, percussion drilling can be used in conjunction with rotary, non-rotary and hybrid methods and the term is not always qualified in company reports. In addition, many drilling rigs are multipurpose and hence can use a combination of drilling methods, including in the same borehole; for example, reverse circulation drilling can be followed by diamond drilling — however, these are both rotary drilling methods. Definitions are compiled from a variety of sources, including the Australian Drilling Industry Association's Drilling Manual (2018, Sixth edition), existing published vocabularies, drilling company webpages, Wikipedia, and a variety reports/publications.",

        "@value": "A rotary percussion drilling method using a cutting tool powered by compressed air that creates a rapid percussion effect coupled with rotary action to drill hard rocks. The hammer can be either down the hole (DHH) at the bottom of the drillstring or at the top of the drillstring (top-hole hammer). Rotary hammer drilling is commonly referred to in industry as percussion drilling and is an ‘open hole’ method, meaning that the drill cuttings are blown up on the outside of the drill rods. Note that percussion is also applied in other methods. For example, reverse circulation (RC) drilling uses this cutting method, but the drill cuttings return to the surface within the drill rods. A rotary hammer is also a common component in rotary air blast (RAB) drilling. Usage of ‘rotary hammer’ is recommended for instances where the ’open hole’ sampling method is used but where details of the sample return method are unknown. It should be avoided if a more specific term is known (e.g. RAB or RC drilling), as well as where it represents only a minor component of the borehole drilling (e.g. bottom of hole for aircore drilling).",
