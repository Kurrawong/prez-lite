The vocabulary focuses on standard terminology from the energy and mineral resources sectors, highlighting instances where the same term carries different meaning in different fields. In the context of this vocabulary, the term fluid energy refers to sources such as gas, petroleum and geothermal, as covered by the Petroleum Legislation Amendment Act 2024, and is exclusive of mineral sources of energy (e.g. coal, uranium). Note that the currency of borehole status data in GSWA's databases is time-stamped, reflecting information gathered from a borehole operator’s well completion report or from a responsible regulatory authority at a specific point in time; subsequent changes are unlikely to be recorded.",
