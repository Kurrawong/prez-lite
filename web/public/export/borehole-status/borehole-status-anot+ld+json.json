        "@value": "This vocabulary combines terminology from the energy and mineral resources industries, with a structure based on the main phases of drilling operations: planning and approval, operational, operations suspended, and post-operational. It is largely based and expands on the 2021 Geoscience Australia (GA) listing (https://db-content.ga.gov.au/data_dictionary/Borehole_Status_vocabulary_2021.pdf, later published at https://pid.geoscience.gov.au/def/voc/ga/BoreholeStatus), \"an amalgam of terms used by professional bodies (e.g. PPDM, CoalLog) and regulatory authorities. Some of the terminology used across these professional domains and jurisdictions has varied over time, and in some cases the same term has a different meaning for different types of boreholes. GA has endeavoured to merge these sources of terminology into a consistent classification that applies for all borehole types.\" As GA's list stemmed largely from the energy sector, GSWA has expanded the vocabulary to cover mineral resources industry terminology, in relation to both drilling and rehabilitation stages. The Geological Survey of Queensland (GSQ) Borehole Status (http://linked.data.gov.au/def/borehole-status) and Borehole Status Event (http://linked.data.gov.au/def/borehole-status-event) vocabularies were also consulted. A draft of the GSWA's vocabulary was shared with the Government Geoscience Information Committee (GGIC) Petroleum Data Working Group, leading to the adoption of concepts from this vocabulary by GSQ (particularly for post-operational stages) and a more consistent approach nationally.",
