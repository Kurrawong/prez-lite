A tectonic unit is defined as a named mass/body of rock with defined geological characteristics (geological structure, sedimentary stratigraphy, magmatic activity, metamorphism, metallogeny and alteration) and evolutionary history different from that of surrounding/contiguous units. A lithotectonic (or lithostructural) unit is defined as an assemblage of rocks unified on the basis of structural or deformational features, mutual relationships, origin, or historical evolution, that: a) is a subset of a larger tectonic unit (e.g. inlier/outlier), b) incorporates components from more than one tectonic units (e.g. greenstone belt), and c) encompasses large tectonic components of the State of Western Australia and/or facilitates the grouping of common tectonic elements at the highest level of the State tectonic hierarchy (e.g. large igneous provinces). Tectonic unit types are an integral part of GSWA's Explanatory Notes System (ENS), a digital repository of detailed unit descriptions that integrates stratigraphic relationships with links to all tectonic units and events recognized in Western Australia. This vocabulary does not attempt to show hierarchical relationships between tectonic types as enforced in ENS, as many are not one-to-one relationships.",

Sedimentary basins range in size from small continental basins to large oceanic basins. The essential element of the concept is the tectonic creation of relief, to provide both a source of sediment and a relatively low place for the deposition of that sediment (after Miall, 2000). In the Western Australian context, most Precambrian basins are tectonic components of either cratons or orogens, whereas Phanerozoic basins do not have an immediate tectonic relationship to any orogen.",

Whether or not an amalgamation of components constitutes a craton depends on the point in geological time at which the overall tectonic configuration is considered. In the Western Australian context, cratons usually comprise component terranes, but can also represent amalgamation(s) of older cratons bounded by orogenic sutures. In the Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) Explanatory Notes System, the latter are ranked as a higher level tectonic unit type to preserve the identity of the original cratons. The nature of tectonic processes that modify cratons, including rifting, accretion and removal of the lithospheric root, result in boundaries between cratons, orogens and basins that can be either sharp or gradational, such that the spatial limit of cratons both at surface and at depth may not always be precisely defined. In the global literature, cratons can be referred to as shields, and basins covering cratons as platforms; these terms are not used by GSWA.",

The rocks of an orogen may include deformed and reworked parts of older (pre-orogenic) lithosphere, as well as new (synorogenic) volcanic, sedimentary and igneous rocks. An orogen is conceived to have been established by a distinct tectonic event of known duration, but it is also possible for orogens to be reactivated during later tectonic episodes, and they normally remain as permanent zones of weakness in the Earth’s crust. A named orogen includes any associated sedimentary rocks, which may not be strongly deformed or metamorphosed, but whose deposition was directly related to the formation of the orogen.
