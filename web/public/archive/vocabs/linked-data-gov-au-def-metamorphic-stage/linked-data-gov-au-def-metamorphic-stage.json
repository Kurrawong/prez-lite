Definitions are taken or derived from:\r\nFettes, D and Desmons, J (eds.) 2007, Metamorphic Rocks: a classification and glossary of terms — Recommendations of the International Union of Geological Sciences Subcommission on the Systematics of Metamorphic Rocks: Cambridge University Press, 244p.",

      "label": "?peak",
      "definition": "Typically reserved for use when: a) overprinting or unclear spatial–textural relationships do not allow discernment of whether all or some of the minerals preserved in the rock are indicative of the highest temperature equilibrium mineral assemblage; or b) the possibility of polymetamorphism is likely. This ambiguity arises, for example, when sluggish reaction kinetics in porphyroblastic minerals at low to moderate pressure/temperature metamorphic conditions lead to metastability."

      "definition": "The mineral assemblage of the rock is tentatively interpreted to represent a (relict) prograde mineral assemblage. This term is used when metamorphic information is cryptically preserved, e.g. within inclusions in porphyroblastic minerals, or there is ambiguity about polymetamorphism."

      "definition": "The mineral assemblage of the rock is tentatively interpreted to represent a (relict) retrograde mineral assemblage. Typically used when the possibility of polymetamorphism is high and/or unclear, i.e. when it cannot be ascertained whether lower temperature metamorphic minerals overprinting a higher grade assemblage formed during the same, single metamorphic cycle, or whether a later, lower temperature event (i.e. retrogressive) overprinted the higher grade assemblage.",

That is, a sequential increase in metamorphic grade with time (within a single metamorphic event) that is recognizable or inferred in a rock. It is that part of the metamorphic cycle up to the thermal maximum (peak metamorphic conditions)."

It is distinguished from retrograde metamorphism by the fact that the development of a lower grade mineral assemblage is ascribed to a separate, discrete metamorphic event that takes place at lower temperatures and a later time than the first metamorphic event."
