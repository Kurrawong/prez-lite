Metabasic rocks are represented by the assemblage albite–epidote–actinolite–chlorite–quartz, analogous to that of the greenschist facies. Metapelitic rocks exhibit the association of muscovite–biotite–chlorite–quartz, analogous to the greenschist facies. The distinction between the greenschist and albite–epidote facies is textural — undeformed hornfels versus foliated schists — rather than mineralogical. It should be noted, though, that although traditionally defined as undeformed, hornfels facies rocks exhibiting deformation features have been documented in the geological record. The facies corresponds to temperatures of about 300–450 °C at pressures less than about 2 kbar. It is typical of metamorphism in the outer parts of contact aureoles, under ultrahigh (geo)thermal gradient and heat flow conditions.

Metapelitic rocks are characterized by diagnostic mineral assemblages containing micas associated with garnet, staurolite, kyanite or sillimanite at higher pressures, and andalusite or cordierite at lower pressures within the facies. Amphibolite facies is typical of regional metamorphism at pressures of about 4.5 – 15kbar and of regional or contact metamorphism at pressures less than about 4.5kbar. Temperatures span the range 450–700 °C, and in situ partial melting of rocks occurs in the upper part of this range (above about 650°C).

Mafic rocks at blueschist facies are represented by combinations of the diagnostic sodic amphibole (e.g. glaucophane, crossite) and lawsonite, sodic pyroxene, aragonite, epidote, and garnet. The mineral pair jadeite–quartz is also diagnostic. Blueschist facies metasiliciclastic rocks may contain diagnostic mineral assemblages involving carpholite, chloritoid, talc, kyanite and phengitic white mica. The facies represents lower temperatures and higher pressures than the greenschist and prehnite–pumpelleyite facies, lower pressures than eclogite facies, and temperatures less than the amphibolite facies (less than about 500°C). At depths indicative of blueschist facies, lower temperatures are not realised in Earth. Blueschist facies metamorphism is associated with tectonic environments in which rocks experience near isothermal compression followed by near isothermal decompression, such as at subduction zones (i.e. unusually low (geo)thermal gradients and heat flow). The term blueschist can also be used as a rock type, so when used as a facies name, the facies context should be made clear (i.e. blueschist-facies rock).",,,,,https://linked.data.gov.au/def/metamorphic-facies
