      "definition": "Describes the apparent direction of the sequential path on a P–T diagram, where the x-axis is temperature, and the y-axis is pressure (with positive ordinates above the abscissa). Anticlockwise P–T paths are those in which the thermal maximum (peak temperature) is reached prior to the peak pressure being attained. These P–T paths generally reflect high (geo)thermal gradient and heat flow conditions."

These P–T paths generally reflect burial and subsequent heating under low to intermediate (geo)thermal gradient and heat flow conditions."
