Anticlockwise P–T paths are those in which the thermal maximum (peak temperature) is reached prior to the peak pressure being attained. These P–T paths generally reflect high (geo)thermal gradient and heat flow conditions.",,,,,https://linked.data.gov.au/def/metamorphic-P-T-trajectory

Clockwise P–T paths are those in which peak pressure is reached prior to peak temperature being attained.
