They may occur as small to large veins, or large zones in the roof of some granites. Greisen is formed by self-generated alteration of a granite and is a class of moderate- to high-temperature magmatic-hydrothermal alteration related to the late-stage release of volatiles dissolved in a magma during the solidification of that magma (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greisen).",,https://linked.data.gov.au/def/gswa-rock-classification-scheme/metasomatic,,,https://linked.data.gov.au/def/gswa-rock-classification-scheme
