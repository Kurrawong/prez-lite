Classification is based on the identification of the most important alteration mineral, the distinctive mineral assemblage, or the chemical changes that have occurred during alteration. Definitions are largely from Pirajno (2009), the Glossary of geology (5th edition revised; Neuendorf et.al., 2011), Thompson et al. (1996), and Wikipedia.",
