Fine to microfine, industrial-grade diamonds are used. They are set within a matrix of varying hardness, from brass to high-grade steel. Matrix hardness, diamond size and dosing can be varied according to the rock which must be cut. Holes within the bit allow water to be delivered to the cutting face. This provides three essential functions: lubrication, cooling and removal of drill cuttings from the hole. Core samples are retrieved via the use of a core tube, a hollow tube placed inside the rod string and pumped with water until it locks into the core barrel. As the core is drilled, the core barrel slides over the core as it is cut. An 'overshot' attached to the end of the winch cable is lowered inside the rod string and locks on to the backend (aka head assembly), located on the top end of the core barrel. The winch is retracted, pulling the core tube to the surface. The core does not drop out of the inside of the core tube when lifted because either a split ring core lifter or basket retainer allow the core to move into, but not back out of the tube.",

Vibrations may also be generated within the drillhead. The frequency is generally between 50 and 180 Hz (cycles per second) and can be varied by the operator. Resonance magnifies the amplitude of the drillbit, which fluidizes the soil particles at the bit face, allowing for fast and easy penetration through most geological formations. An internal spring system isolates these vibrational forces from the rest of the drill rig.",

      "definition": "A list of drilling methods routinely used by the mineral and energy resource industries. The drilling methods are grouped into three main categories based on the dominant motion of the drillstem (i.e. the string of pipe that transmits power from the surface down to the drillbit) and drillbit (the part of the bottom-hole assembly that cuts, grinds or breaks the bottom-hole formation to make the hole). Specifically, the presence/absence of rotation in either or both is used as the main distinguishing factor, hence the main grouping into rotary, non-rotary and hybrid. Most drilling used by the mineral and energy resource industries falls into the rotary drilling category. Note that alternative classification schemes can use parameters such as the hole-making method in combination with the hole-clearing and stabilizing method and/or the type of sample produced (e.g. core versus chips). These methods can cross over between the main categories used here; for example, percussion drilling can be used in conjunction with rotary, non-rotary and hybrid methods and the term is not always qualified in company reports. In addition, many drilling rigs are multipurpose and hence can use a combination of drilling methods, including in the same borehole; for example, reverse circulation drilling can be followed by diamond drilling — however, these are both rotary drilling methods. Definitions are compiled from a variety of sources, including the Australian Drilling Industry Association's Drilling Manual (2018, Sixth edition), existing published vocabularies, drilling company webpages, Wikipedia, and a variety reports/publications.",

The drill cuttings are removed by injection of compressed air into the hole via the annular area between the inner tube and the drill rod. The cuttings are then blown back to the surface up the inner tube where they pass through the sample separating system and are collected if needed. Drilling continues with the addition of rods to the top of the drillstring. Air core drilling can occasionally produce small chunks of cored rock.

This is preferred because there is no need to return intact samples to surface for assay as the objective is to reach a formation containing oil or natural gas. Sizable machinery is used, enabling depths of several kilometres to be penetrated. Rotating hollow drillpipes carry down bentonite and barite infused drilling muds to lubricate, cool, and clean the drilling bit, control downhole pressures, stabilize the wall of the borehole and remove drill cuttings. Also used in minerals exploration to penetrate difficult ground (i.e. swelling clays or waste rock) without stopping, to reduce cost or the chance of bogging.",

This is the reverse of the air path employed in normal ‘open hole’ rotary percussion drilling (including RAB drilling). At the top of the hole, the air and drill cuttings are passed through a cyclone to collect the cuttings for sampling. The RC drilling technique prevents the upcoming sample from being contaminated with material from the wall of the hole above the sampling depth. RC drilling utilizes much larger rigs and machinery and comparatively higher air pressure. Depths of up to 500 m are routinely achieved.",

Rotary hammer drilling is commonly referred to in industry as percussion drilling and is an ‘open hole’ method, meaning that the drill cuttings are blown up on the outside of the drill rods. Note that percussion is also applied in other methods. For example, reverse circulation (RC) drilling uses this cutting method, but the drill cuttings return to the surface within the drill rods. A rotary hammer is also a common component in rotary air blast (RAB) drilling. Usage of ‘rotary hammer’ is recommended for instances where the ’open hole’ sampling method is used but where details of the sample return method are unknown. It should be avoided if a more specific term is known (e.g. RAB or RC drilling), as well as where it represents only a minor component of the borehole drilling (e.g. bottom of hole for aircore drilling).",
