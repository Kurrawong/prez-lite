There is considerable overlap with the fields of ecology, evolutionary biology, microbiology, paleontology, and particularly soil science and biogeochemistry. Geobiology applies the principles and methods of biology, geology and soil science to the study of the ancient history of the co-evolution of life and Earth as well as the role of life in the modern world. Geobiological studies tend to be focused on micro-organisms, and on the role that life plays in altering the chemical and physical environment of the pedosphere, which exists at the intersection of the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and/or cryosphere. It differs from biogeochemistry in that the focus is on processes and organisms over space and time rather than on global chemical cycles.",

The technique uses discrete layers of tephra (volcanic ash from a single eruption) to create a chronological framework in which paleoenvironmental or archeological records can be placed. The premise of the technique is that each volcanic event produces ash with a unique chemical 'fingerprint' that allows the deposit to be identified across the area affected by fallout. Thus, once the volcanic event has been independently dated, the tephra horizon will act as time marker (as such it is a variant of the basic geological technique of stratigraphy).",

Traditionally, urban planning followed a top-down approach in master planning the physical layout of human settlements, with a primary focus on public welfare (i.e. considerations of efficiency, sanitation, protection and use of the environment) as well as effects of the master plans on the social and economic activities. Over time, urban planning's focus has shifted to social and environmental factors to be a tool to improve the health and well-being of people while maintaining sustainability standards.",
