These quantities are products of the absorbed dose in rads and weighting factors. These factors must be selected for each exposure situation; there is no universally applicable conversion constant from rad to rem. A rem is a large dose of radiation, so the millirem (mrem), which is one thousandth of a rem, is often used for the dosages commonly encountered, such as the amount of radiation received from medical x-rays and background sources.",,,,,https://linked.data.gov.au/def/uom-geoscience

The most important property of a conductor is the amount of current it will carry when a voltage is applied. Current flow is opposed by resistance in all circuits, and by also by reactance and impedance in alternating current circuits. Conductance, susceptance and admittance are the inverses of resistance, reactance and impedance, respectively. To measure these properties, the siemens is the reciprocal of the ohm (Ω). In other words, the conductance, susceptance or admittance, in siemens, is simply 1 divided by the resistance, reactance or impedance, respectively, in ohms.

The eotvos was used in conjunction with the older Centimetre–Gram–Second (CGS) system of units and is defined as 10⁻⁹ galileos per centimetre.
