  "description": "Terms that describe the ratio of temperature to pressure (T/P) during metamorphism, defining a classification scheme based on thermal gradient that is regarded as the most appropriate for building a temporal geodynamic context for metamorphic data. Some of these terms only partly correspond to metamorphic facies fields and classic-style terminology such as Barrovian and Buchan (i.e. correspondence is not one-for-one).",

      "definition": "High geothermal gradient or high apparent thermal gradient metamorphism, characterized by high heat flow. That is, temperature increases more rapidly than average with depth. Defined by apparent thermal gradients between 77.5 and 150 °C/kbar (or 775 and 1500 °C/GPa), and encompassing most of what is traditionally referred to as Barrovian style metamorphism. High thermal gradients encompass the middle and lower pressure range of amphibolite facies as well as the pressure range of typical granulites and ultra-high temperature granulites. Thermal gradient is defined in terms of pressure (i.e. thermobarometric ratio) rather than depth in kilometres to avoid assumptions involving density-related conversions.",

Defined by apparent thermal gradients between 37.5 and 77.5°C/kbar (or 375 and 775°C/GPa), and encompassing, at the higher thermal gradient end of the range, the higher pressure part of what is traditionally referred to as Barrovian-style metamorphism.
