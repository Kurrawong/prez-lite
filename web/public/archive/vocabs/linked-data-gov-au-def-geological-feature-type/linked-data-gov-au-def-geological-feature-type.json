  "description": "This vocabulary lists the fundamental types of geological features that are used to define the geological framework/4D evolution of Western Australia and are relevant to the duties of the Geological Survey of Western Australia. A geological feature is a physical or conceptual feature that is hypothesized to exist coherently in the Earth and that results from geological processes (definition largely derived from SWEET ontology http://sweetontology.net/realmGeol#geologicfeature).",

Critical components of a mineral system include a source of metals, a mode of transport, a site of deposition or accumulation where commodities become concentrated and are preserved to enable economically viable extraction during a given period. A mineral system model permits classification of known deposit types or styles into a genetically related family based on their association with the above factors."

The petroleum supersystem links sedimentary packages of similar age, structural history, depositional environment and hydrocarbon potential, both within and between basins. Thus, the petroleum supersystems approach can potentially be a powerful exploration tool for predicting the petroleum systems elements in frontier basins with limited datasets (Bradshaw et al 1994)."

Structural features are divided into two broad classes: those acquired during the genesis of a rock mass (primary structure, e.g. bedding) or by later deformation or displacement of primary structures and of the rocks (secondary structures, e.g. a fold or fault)."
