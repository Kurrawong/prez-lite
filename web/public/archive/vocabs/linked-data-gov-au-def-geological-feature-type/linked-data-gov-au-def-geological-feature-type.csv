It includes major forms such as plain, plateau and mountain, and minor forms such as hill, valley, slope, esker and dune. Taken together, the landforms make up the surface configuration of the Earth.",,,,,https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geological-feature-type

It represents the basic unit of geological mapping and includes formally defined stratigraphic and lithodemic units (cf Australian Stratigraphic Units Database, www.ga.gov.au/data-pubs/datastandards/stratigraphic-units) as well as lithotectonic units defined solely on the basis of lithologic properties and inclusion within a tectonic unit.",,,"https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geological-feature-type/formal-unit|https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geological-feature-type/lithotectonic-unit",,https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geological-feature-type

Critical components of a mineral system include a source of metals, a mode of transport, a site of deposition or accumulation where commodities become concentrated and are preserved to enable economically viable extraction during a given period. A mineral system model permits classification of known deposit types or styles into a genetically related family based on their association with the above factors.",,,,,https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geological-feature-type

The petroleum supersystem links sedimentary packages of similar age, structural history, depositional environment and hydrocarbon potential, both within and between basins. Thus, the petroleum supersystems approach can potentially be a powerful exploration tool for predicting the petroleum systems elements in frontier basins with limited datasets (Bradshaw et al 1994).",,,,,https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geological-feature-type
