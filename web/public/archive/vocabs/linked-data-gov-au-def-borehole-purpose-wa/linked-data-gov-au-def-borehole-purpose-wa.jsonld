      "definition": "The primary purpose for which a borehole was drilled or any secondary purpose that the borehole may acquire during its lifecycle. The vocabulary focuses on drilling purposes within the resources industry, with a focus on terminology as applied in the Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) databases. Some terms covered by jurisdictional legislation are highlighted in the provenance field. Variations in terminology within definitions (i.e. usage of borehole, well and wellbore) stem from usage in different sectors of the resources industry, but for the purpose of this vocabulary are considered to be equivalent. In the context of this vocabulary, the term fluid energy refers to sources such as gas, petroleum and geothermal, as covered by the Petroleum Legislation Amendment Act 2024, and is exclusive of mineral sources of energy (e.g. coal, uranium).

Holes are drilled at intervals and cased with slotted casing, allowing groundwater entry and thus regular checking and sample collection/analysis to determine any variations in the height of the water table, water pressure, water quality, presence of contaminants and salinity.",
