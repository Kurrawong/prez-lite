It is the most common method of reference for locations in a borehole. In the minerals industry, it usually refers to the distance from the drill collar. Inthe oil industry, 'depth' also refers to the location itself. By extension, depth can refer to locations below, or distances from, a reference point or elevation, even when there is no well. In that sense, depth is a concept related toelevation, albeit in the opposite direction. Depth in a borehole is not necessarily measured vertically or along a straight line. Because boreholes are not always drilled vertically, there may be two 'depths' for every given point in a borehole: themeasured depth(MD)measured along the path of theborehole, and thetrue vertical depth(TVD), the absolute vertical distance between thereference datumand the point in theborehole. In perfectly vertical holes, the TVD equals the MD; otherwise, the TVD is less than the MD measured from the same datum. Common references used are reduced level (RL), drill collar, ground level (GL),drilling rigfloor (DF),rotary table(RT),kelly bushing(KB or RKB) andmean sea level(MSL).",

      "definition": "A seismic reference datum (SRD) is used in land seismic projects as a reference surface to counteract the fact that elevation on land is variable. An SRD is a plane that sits above the highest elevation in the data. In a land project with a seismic reference datum set, the SRD will have a time of 0 ms. All time data, for example seismic and velocities, will start at this datum. Marine seismic is usually referenced to mean sea level (MSL), a global datum for measuring height. In a marine project, zero elevation (the mean sea level) will have a time of 0 ms.",
