Geodes differ from vugs in that geodes can be separated free from any matrix, because their walls commonly weather out of rock exposures. Unlike a druse, a geode is separable (by weathering) as a discrete concretion from the rock in which it occurs, and its inner crystals are not of the same minerals as those of the enclosing rock.
